# Tetris React App

It's a personnal project made during my training at the Wild Code School (Lille, France).

The game is based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUt3Mf9MYhc&list=PL0jpcQ5lO0nEH2BpPmJhePz_urgyAljFB) made by [Weibenfalk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnnWy4UTYN258FfVGeXBbg)

## Time spent

## Production (on Netlify)

Coming soon ;)
